# CombDPI
Predicting drug-protein interactions based on similarity reconstruction and adaptive combination algorithm

# Quick Start
to reproduce our results:
1. Download and unzip our code files
2. Run data_devide_davis.py (or data_devide_drugbank.py) to reproduce cross-validation data for each fold.
3. Run CombDPI_davis.py (or CombDPI_drugbank.py) to predict and evaluate our prediction results.

# Noteworthy
The similarity matrices in the dataset/drugbank/similarity_matrices.zip package need to be extracted into the dataset/drugbank folder

# Contacts
