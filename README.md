# BRWCP
BRCWP: Drug-Protein Interaction Prediction by Correcting the Effect of Incomplete Information in Heterogeneous Information
# Quick Start
to reproduce our results:
1. Download and unzip our code files
2. Run dti_devide.py to reproduce DTI data and their indexes for each fold and save them to ./dataset
3. Run run_main.py to reproduce the ten fold mean true positive rate list, false positive rate list, precision list, and reacll list about drug of the prediction results, and save them to ./result  

#CombDPi
CombDPI: CombDPI: Combinatorial Optimization Prediction Model of Drug Repositioning Based on Network-Level Information

##Quick Start
to reproduce our results:
1.Download and unzip our code files
2.Run data_devide_davis.py (data_devide_drugbank.py) to reproduce cross-validation data for each fold.
3.Run CombDPI_davis.py (CombDPI_drugbank.py) to predict and evaluate our prediction results.

##noteworthy
The similarity matrices package in the drugbank folder needs to be extracted into the drugbank folder
